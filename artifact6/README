Strong scaling tests, information 
=================================
All LAMMPS tests were run using the July 22nd, 2025 "stable" release (https://github.com/lammps/lammps/releases/tag/stable_22Jul2025) compiled using the included Kokkos library (v4.6.02).

IMPORTANT: 
This README contains environment settings, modules, and other details for strong scaling runs on ALCF's Aurora machine and OLCF's Frontier machine. 
Environment settings and modules for scaling on NNSA's El Capitan machine and NVIDIA's Eos machine cannot be released publicly.
Please contact the manuscript authors with further questions.


Aurora, environment and build
=============================
Modules used:
gcc/13.3.0
oneapi/release/2025.0.5

Environment variable commands:
export IGC_EnableGEPLSRMulExpr=1
export IGC_RunGEPLSRAfterLICM=1
export IGC_GEPLSRThresholdRatio=10000
export IGC_DisableRecompilation=1

Aurora-specific build instructions:
- Copy strong-scaling/sna_kokkos.h and strong-scaling/sna_kokkos_impl.h into your lammps/src/KOKKOS directory
- Copy strong-scaling/Makefile.aurora_kokkos into your lammps/src/MAKE/MACHINE directory
- Load the modules and exported environment variables listed above, then compile in lammps/src using the 'make aurora_kokkos -jN' command (where N = number of processors)


Frontier, environment and build
===============================
Modules used:
cray-mpich/8.1.31 
amd/6.2.0 
rocm/6.2.0

No special build instructions required. The standard LAMMPS Makefile for Frontier has been included in strong-scaling/Makefile.frontier_kokkos for inspection.


Notes on figure6
================
The directory figure6 contains the code and data required to generate the 6th figure in the manuscript.
It was generated using the LaTeX libraries 'tikz' and 'pgfplots'.
Please see the README in the 'artifact1' directory for further information on these libraries and settings used for this work.
