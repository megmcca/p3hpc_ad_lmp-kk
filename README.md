Artifact description for SC25 paper submission "LAMMPS-KOKKOS: Performance Portable Molecular Dynamics Across Exascale Architectures"

NOTE: not uploading data for figures 3 (carveout) and 6 (scaling) until permission granted

Data was generated from a variety of LAMMPS-KOKKOS compilations and computing environments. 
All data from computations is shown in one of the six total figures. 
For that reason, we have opted to organize artifact description in terms of each figure.

Each folder has:
- Numbered figure script, which were each compiled using tex packages 'pgfplots' and 'tikz',
- Data file(s) used in the figure script,
- Text files for each machine that detail (1) the machine's environment and module settings and (2) the LAMMPS version and compile settings for that machine,
- Any batch scripts that were used to execute the LAMMPS input scripts for figure data.
